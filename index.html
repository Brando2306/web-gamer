                THE VISION<br><br>
                Giblatön was now a very different place, the original planet had been transformed. Immense forests

                formed meandering rivers of crystalline waters and the sound of life flowed with harmony from anywhere
                on the planet. The great mountain of Lamaintula, majestic as ever, still dominated the place, and at its
                highest point, the enormous silhouettes of the ten gods seemed to outline a peculiar rocky massif.
                Giblon had created his nine gods with a mission, with a task, each one had to execute it with effort and
                rigour, and seeing what that planet had become, they had fulfilled their objective.

                However, perhaps all that work could be threatened and the concern of Giblon, the god of gods, was

                something terrible was going to happen. He could see a kind of... war?
                He saw many golems, but he also observed other kinds of seemingly ferocious creatures.

                All their power circulated within them, it was part of their nature. Between them, they had perfect

                majestic beast
                with unparalleled power and knowledge. The Galactic Orb he possessed, had control over time and life. He
                knew the past and could observe the future through it.

                After millions of years alone in Mount Lamaintula, he had a terrifying sighting through his orb.
                Something terrible was going to happen in the near future. He knew he had to do something to preserve
                the state of things
                This is why he finally decided to use the power of the Orb to create the other Gods to help him rule the
                planet and its future.
                Each of them was created with his own purpose and power, but all were extremely powerful.

                and towers that sealed the golem territory.
                No golem dared to look him in the eyes, it was said that your body would become a solid block of diamond

                RUDE GOLEMS: THE STORY <br><br>
                In the twilight of the Genesis era, at the dawn of the end of creation, in a dark and unknown time,
                Giblatön roared with the shattering power of its inhabitants. Forged in the bowels of the earth with
                the power of the almighty creator and gestated in the boiling womb of the interior of Mount Lamaintula,
                those creatures disturbed the silence of the place. Minerals, rock and strange materials only known
                there gave shape to enormous beings with the innate virtue of creating chaos and destruction wherever
                they dwelled, golems were called. Rude Golems.

                GIBLATÖN: ORIGIN<br><br>
                In the confines of the Solana pentagalaxy, in its darkest and most unexplored vortex, after the
                collision
                of two great stars, a small and inert planet emerged. Eight suns and eight moons provided light and
                darkness
                to Giblatön, a territory all inhospitable and disturbing. Its atmosphere was dense and seemed to vibrate
                to
                the sound of the multitude of volcanoes that with their roar tinged the environment with colourful
                gaseous
                emanations and incandescent materials. It was a strange place, different, devoid of life, and yet
                magical,
                despite its apparent lack of gravity in which the rocks seemed to want to float, an inner force, for
                millions
                of years, wanted to catch something...

                GIBLON: GENESIS <br><br>
                Eight suns, eight moons, eight eclipses... An unique and disturbing fact, a call. At the highest point
                of Mount
                Lamaintula, eight runes that remained hidden in large granite rocks began to shine brightly. A silent
                chant of
                intense colour began to dye that mountain with light, it was a chant of attraction, hypnotic and
                powerful attraction.
                The light of the mountain contrasted with the perpetual darkness of the eclipsed night, until suddenly a
                small light
                appeared in space, an interstellar fragment wrapped in a bright and majestic aura that travelled swiftly
                towards Giblatön.
                And at last, with a roar that echoed throughout the planet, the two lights merged. It would be difficult
                to say whether
                the being that now crowned Mount Lamaintula was born from the bowels of the earth or came from the ends

                GODS: THE BEGINNING <br><br>
                Giblon, the Golem Creator, had been wandering around his inert planet for many years (thousands, perhaps
                millions), his
                solitary existence was not an easy task, his Galactic Orb was his guide and his oracle, and his mission
                was to make Giblatön
                a living and powerful planet within Solana.<br><br>
                For a long time, he had tried to sow the germ of life, to bring order to the space and physics of his
                planet, to its elements,
                its matter, but despite his extreme power, it was a Dantesque task, something he now knew he couldn’t do
                alone.

                in charge of guarding the access to the Mount, where the gods gathered.
                If you aroused his wrath, with his huge Golemite steel ax, he would open huge breaches in the
                ground.<br><br>
                NYGHTUM, THE SKY GOD: <br>
                Strong electrical forces and toxic gases form his body, providing it with enough power to change
                Giblatön's meteorology.
                As the God of the skies, Nyghtum is able to physically transform into sky and the weather itself, even
                becoming massive in his physical size.

            <div class="carousel-cell column left">
                Being immune to all forms of physical harm makes him almost invincible. He is also very Rude.<br><br>
                ROOTON, THE NATURE GOD: <br>
                Rooton is the god in charge of creating and protecting the flora and fauna of Giblatön. It's formed by
                branches of millenary trees.
                His body acts as a home for various creatures present on the Golems' planet. With the Life Cane, he is
                able to change the
                environment, return to live dead flora and when he's mad,
                even drain others' spirits.
                He is the biggest in size of all the Gods, he does not like to talk much and he will cage you in a wall
                of thick branches
                and spikes forever if you dare to disturb him.

                G7-XSOL, THE OTHERWORLDLY GOD: <br>
                A ball of fire impacted at a high speed against Giblatön many, many years ago. It was a huge spaceship
                from another universe.
                This great ship was built with galactic materials that seemed to have special qualities and incredible
                hardness. Only the
                Creator God was able to observe this event, and in his quest to create other gods, he decided to use the
                remains of this
                great ship to give life to the seventh God. G-7 XSOL was a mechanized golem, different from all others.
                It has thrusters
                all over its body that allows him to move through the air at great speeds. His hydraulic systems fed
                with radioactive
                material allowed him to carry heavy weights and fly without any difficulty, it is also very hard to
                damage, his armor
                is extremely resistant. A mecha golem from another universe. Curious, isn't it?

                GOLOWAR, THE ATTACK GOD: <br>
                Inside this God there is only war. He was born to battle.
                The huge sword he handles not only serves to slice through his enemies, but it gives him a relentless
                war instict.
                Golowar has a supernatural speed that allows him to move fast and forcefully, he is way more agile than
                anyone else.
                The strength that his sword gives him makes him a killing machine. He is a melee master He loves to
                annihilate, to destroy,
                anger is part of him. No matter what stands in front of him, he could instantly end its life.
                He is the holder of the Annihilating Power.
